# NCERT AI Learning Platform

This repository contains a syllabus-locked,
modular AI learning platform for Classes 1–12.

---

## CORE PRINCIPLES

- Curriculum is immutable
- Learning flow is deterministic
- AI is assistive, never authoritative
- UI is replaceable
- New features must not require refactoring

---

## REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION

Class 9 → Mathematics  
Chapter 2 → Polynomials  
Section 2.2 → Polynomials in One Variable

If this section works end-to-end,
the platform is considered valid.
