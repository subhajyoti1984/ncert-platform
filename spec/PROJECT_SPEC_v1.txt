====================

PROJECT NAME:
-------------
(Modular AI Learning Platform – NCERT-first, Classes 1–12)

ONE-LINE DEFINITION:
-------------------
A modular, syllabus-locked AI learning platform for classes 1–12 that teaches
concept-by-concept, adapts to student personality and weaknesses, supports
multilingual text and voice, integrates practice, exams, forums, live tutors,
and payments — without requiring re-engineering when new features are added.

===========================================================
SECTION 1: NON-NEGOTIABLE DESIGN PRINCIPLES (FROZEN)
===========================================================

1. MODULAR ARCHITECTURE
   - The system MUST be built as independent modules.
   - Adding a new feature MUST NOT require rewriting existing modules.

2. LEARNING CORE IS IMMUTABLE
   - Core teaching logic and syllabus structure never change.
   - AI, UI, payments, tutors, forums plug into it.

3. CONTENT ≠ INTELLIGENCE ≠ PRESENTATION
   - Content (syllabus) is static and canonical.
   - Intelligence (AI, diagnostics, orchestration) is separate.
   - Presentation (UI, animations, voice) is replaceable.

4. DETERMINISTIC TEACHING FLOW
   - No free-chat learning.
   - Learning follows a fixed state machine.

5. ENGLISH-CANONICAL SYLLABUS CORE
   - All syllabus content is stored in English.
   - Local languages are rendering layers only.
   - Mathematical terms are NEVER translated.

6. PROGRESSIVE ENHANCEMENT
   - MVP works with minimal modules.
   - Advanced features attach later without refactor.

===========================================================
SECTION 2: USER EXPERIENCE (WHAT USERS SEE)
===========================================================

The app has EXACTLY FIVE primary user-facing screens in v1.

SCREEN 1: SETUP (ONE-TIME)
--------------------------
User selects:
- Class (1–12)
- Board (CBSE / ICSE / State)
- Subject
- Preferred explanation language

Stored in user profile.
Never asked again unless changed.

SCREEN 2: CHAPTER LIST
---------------------
Shows list of chapters for selected class + subject.
Pure navigation. No teaching.

SCREEN 3: CHAPTER OVERVIEW
-------------------------
Shows:
- What the chapter is about
- Skills student will gain
- Why it matters
- Connection to future chapters
- Estimated learning time

SCREEN 4: SECTION LIST
---------------------
Shows all sections inside the chapter.
Each section is independent.

SCREEN 5: LEARNING LOOP (CORE SCREEN)
------------------------------------
This screen repeats for every concept.

Each loop:
1. Explain ONE idea
2. Ask one or more questions (as configured)
3. Evaluate response
4. Diagnose mistakes
5. Correct and proceed

No long lectures.
No uncontrolled conversation.

===========================================================
SECTION 3: UNIVERSAL CURRICULUM SKELETON
===========================================================

This skeleton applies to ALL classes, ALL subjects, ALL chapters.

STRUCTURE:
----------
Class
 └── Subject
      └── Chapter
           ├── Chapter Meta
           ├── Section
           │    ├── Section Meta
           │    ├── Concept 1
           │    ├── Concept 2
           │    └── Section Summary
           └── Chapter Summary

This structure is LOCKED forever.

===========================================================
SECTION 4: CONCEPT (ATOMIC TEACHING UNIT)
===========================================================

A CONCEPT is the smallest teachable unit.

Each concept contains ONLY:

- Concept ID
- Concept title
- Canonical explanation (2–4 lines, English)
- One or more checkpoint questions
- Expected mistake patterns
- Optional visual / animation tags

A concept NEVER contains:
- UI logic
- AI prompts
- Language translations
- Payment logic

===========================================================
SECTION 5: TEACHING STATE MACHINE (LEARNING CORE)
===========================================================

STATE MACHINE (FINAL):
---------------------
START_CONCEPT
 → EXPLAIN
 → QUESTION_LOOP
      → EVALUATE
      → (CORRECT | WRONG)
      → (RETRY | NEXT_QUESTION | ADVANCE)
 → CONCEPT_COMPLETE

KEY RULES:
----------
- Multiple questions per concept are supported.
- Advancement requires conceptual correctness.
- Repeated mistakes trigger escalation.

===========================================================
SECTION 6: MODULE ARCHITECTURE (FINAL & COMPLETE)
===========================================================

MODULE 1: INFRASTRUCTURE
-----------------------
Purpose:
- Deployment, databases, APIs, logging.

MVP:
- Minimal backend + storage.

MODULE 2: AUTHENTICATION & IDENTITY
----------------------------------
Features:
- Register / Login
- Google login
- Facebook login
- OTP login
- Logout
- Session management

Provides:
- user_id
- role
- class
- board

Does NOT know learning logic.

MODULE 3: PAYMENT & ACCESS CONTROL
---------------------------------
Features:
- Subscriptions
- Pay-per-feature
- Live tutor payments
- Feature gating

Controls ACCESS only.
Does not control content or teaching.

MVP: Stubbed (free access).

MODULE 4: CURRICULUM SKELETON ENGINE (IMMUTABLE)
-----------------------------------------------
Defines:
- Classes
- Subjects
- Chapters
- Sections
- Concepts

Pure data. No behavior.

MODULE 5: LEARNING CORE ENGINE (HEART)
-------------------------------------
Controls:
- Teaching flow
- Progression
- Mastery
- Retry logic

Does NOT know:
- Language
- AI
- Tutors
- UI
- Payments

MODULE 6: ORCHESTRATION ENGINE (FLEXIBILITY CORE)
------------------------------------------------
Decides WHO responds when help is needed.

Routes to:
- AI
- Live tutor (chat/video)
- Forum
- Retry explanation

Learning core only signals "stuck".

MODULE 7: AI EXPLANATION ENGINE
-------------------------------
Responsibilities:
- Explain canonical content
- Diagnose mistakes
- Adapt tone (personality)
- Produce bilingual text
- Produce voice-ready output

STRICT LIMITS:
- Cannot invent syllabus
- Cannot skip steps
- Cannot change flow

MODULE 8: STUDENT PROFILE & PERSONALITY ENGINE
---------------------------------------------
Stores:
- Pace (slow/normal/fast)
- Tone (serious/friendly)
- Depth (basic/advanced)
- Weak concepts

Affects HOW teaching happens, not WHAT.

MVP: Neutral defaults.

MODULE 9: DIAGNOSTICS & PROGRESS ENGINE
--------------------------------------
Tracks:
- Strengths
- Weaknesses
- Mistake patterns
- Recommendations

Outputs dashboards and advice.

MODULE 10: PRACTICE & EXERCISES ENGINE
-------------------------------------
Supports:
- Solved examples (future)
- Unsolved exercises
- Step checking
- Adaptive practice

Reuses learning core.

MODULE 11: EXAM & TEST SERIES ENGINE
-----------------------------------
Supports:
- Chapter tests
- Section tests
- Full syllabus tests
- Timed exams

MODULE 12: LIVE TUTOR INTEGRATION
--------------------------------
Supports:
- Chat tutoring
- Video calls
- Booking
- Billing

Integrated via Orchestration Engine.

MODULE 13: DISCUSSION FORUM
--------------------------
Supports:
- Concept-linked questions
- Community answers
- Reputation & moderation

Forum answers NEVER advance learning progress.

MODULE 14: EXPERIENCE (UI / UX)
-------------------------------
Responsible for:
- Screens
- Animations
- Diagrams
- Voice playback
- Themes

Can be rewritten anytime.

===========================================================
SECTION 7: LANGUAGE & VOICE STRATEGY
===========================================================

- Canonical content is English.
- Student selects any local language.
- Explanation output = English + selected language.
- Math terms remain English.
- Same pipeline supports Text + Voice (TTS).

===========================================================
SECTION 8: FLEXIBILITY GUARANTEE
===========================================================

Late-time features (forums, tutors, payments, exams, new subjects)
MUST integrate via:
- Orchestration Engine
- Responder interfaces

Learning core is NEVER modified.

===========================================================
SECTION 9: MVP BUILD ORDER (LOCKED)
===========================================================

MVP MUST include:
1. Module 4 – Curriculum Skeleton
2. Module 5 – Learning Core
3. Module 6 – Orchestration (AI only)
4. Module 7 – AI Explanation
5. Module 14 – Minimal UI

Everything else is Phase 2 or Phase 3.

===========================================================
SECTION 10: REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION
===========================================================

Section 2.2 (Polynomials in One Variable) is the reference section.

If Section 2.2 works end-to-end:
- All other sections will work by replication.
